*And finally the mountain was asked: "What do you think of technology?"*
# The Technology Ethic

*On Earth we are born; in earth we die,  
In God we trust; on gods we rely.*  

*The flames of justice are blown by the wind of change,  
And in this chaos, Man has been estranged.*  

*O‚Äô Mighty Men, have we forgotten the truth?  
Soil is our body and bearer of fruit.*

*So confuse not our gift of fire for a given,  
The same flame can consume us, if not mindfully driven.*  

## Homo Faber/Sapien?

Man is a technologist; He has tinkered with, for, and around technology since the dawn of His existence as Mankind. Man is also an ethicist; He is wise as His name implies. But the quiet calling of higher knowledge points to just one humbling reality: that we are beings of the Land ‚Äì our foremost forgotten duty.

In light of recent developments in technology, it is perhaps fitting that we have a recent development in ethics. The efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) have changed how we operate as a society, both in labor and culture. Hans Jonas argues for this point, in ‚ÄúThe Imperative of Responsibility‚Äù, when saying ‚Äúthe nature of human action has changed, and, since ethics is concerned with action, it should follow that the changed nature of human action calls for a change in ethics as well‚Äù (Jonas). Aldo Leopold‚Äôs Land Ethic, outlined in ‚ÄúA Sand County Almanac‚Äù, serves as the perfect soil for fostering this view, and I will argue in this paper that the only lasting way to unite our identities as both Fabers and Sapiens is to develop technology in harmony with the Land; specifically that the Land thinks positively of the technology we make.

The first question that naturally arises is: why the Land Ethic? I find that Jonas and Leopold might agree on the point that past ethics, for the most part, have been anthropocentric ‚Äì and that this does not work in the age of AGI. Leopold discusses how there is ethics with the self, ethics with the community, and ethics with the Land ‚Äì and that these are stages of realization. AGI has come to shove, and it is time for us to realize that, in this effort, there is no ethic that we can sufficiently derive from merely tunneling in on any specific thing; whatever we choose to look at suggests a tendency to exclude, from the moral community, that which we did not. In such cases, we have to reason holistically with all which we can sense; ‡§π‡§∞‡§ø ‡•ê ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç.  

Today, the brilliance of the Land Ethic creed remains relevant and self-evident: ‚ÄúA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise‚Äù (Leopold). The plain fact is that if the Land does not exist, we do not exist. So what good could any more constrained ethic be if we are too perished to practice it?

So the question I will attempt to answer is: what does the Land think of technology? To understand this, we need to understand technology itself.

Technology is an impressive expression; it immortalizes the intent behind which the technology was made, cementing its message within the confines of its medium. Marshall McLuhan‚Äôs theory of extensions discusses how various technologies serve as extensions for existing faculties of the human being. This provides an interesting perspective on the evolution of humanity as correlated with the evolution of our technological capabilities. And like Darwinian evolution, choice is very much an illusion. For example, the first monkeys to walk on two feet might have thought it was an exerciseable choice, but, for the sake of experiment, try maneuvering around like a chimp and you will quickly realize that something has been lost in this process ‚Äì and so is the case with technology.

*That fire being harnessed to control nature sparked a controlling nature within Man;  
That driving past the city gates was a gateway to overstepping our bounds in the Land;  
That entertaining news rewired us to perceive all news as merely entertainment;*  

Neil Postman suggests an inherent evil of technological pleasure-maxing in ‚ÄúEntertaining Ourselves to Death‚Äù; the phrase ‚Äúthe medium is the metaphor‚Äù rings true today and is a call for developers to understand that our final and greatest invention, AGI, is not immune to this effect on us ‚Äì or the Land. In other words, just as we are liable to entertain ourselves to death through the use of technology, it is fitting to think that the Land is also capable of doing as such. This is why it is misguided to conceive of a Technology Ethic and a Land Ethic in different terms; the fate of one is inextricably linked to the other, so how we develop one will inform how the other responds.

So we ought to proceed with caution, and Leopold lays out an important groundwork for this when saying ‚ÄúA river or stream is a cycle of energy from sun to plants to insects to fish. It is a continuum broken only by humans‚Äù (Leopold). We are offered a tender choice in life: become circuit breakers, or circuit builders. Technology lends us the ability to rapidly destroy the Land, but it also gives us a chance to demonstrate its beauty ‚Äì and it is only in promoting this energy pyramid that technology shines.

Would the eskimo have seen the sand dunes ‚Äì or the sand dunes have known of the eskimo ‚Äì if not for technology?

For the sake of demonstration, consider the technology of computing. What once was a giant contraption that often occupied an entire room is now a pocket-sized device that is interfaced with the use of gestures ‚Äì and we prefer the latter to no one‚Äôs surprise. It complements our features, breathes life into metal, and is beautiful.

## Thinking like a Mountain

So just as we like to interface with technology that complements our human features, the Land likes to interface with technology that naturally works with it ‚Äì and the Land rewards such behavior just like we would.

*Is it not the path of least resistance to harness moving air than to rape the ground for power?  
Is it not easier to eat the meat around the seed than to cage life in machines of perpetual torture?  
Is it not evident that Man has failed in His duties to the Land ‚Äì losing His status as an ethicist?*
