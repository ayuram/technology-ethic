*And finally the mountain was asked: "What do you think of technology?"*
# The Technology Ethic
*On Earth we are born; in earth we die,  
In God we trust; on gods we rely.*

*The flames of justice are blown by the wind of change,  
And in this chaos, Man has been estranged.*

*O‚Äô Mighty Men, have you forgotten the truth?  
Soil is our body and bearer of fruit.*

*So confuse not your gift of fire for a given,  
The same flame can consume us, if not mindfully driven.* 

## Homo Faber/Sapien?

Man is a technologist; He has tinkered with, for, and around flames and tools since the dawn of His existence as Mankind. Man is also an ethicist; He is wise as His name implies. But the quiet calling of higher knowledge points to just one humbling reality: that we are beings of the Land ‚Äì our foremost forgotten duty.

In light of recent developments in technology, it is perhaps fitting that we have a recent development in ethics. The efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) have changed how we operate as a society, both in labor and culture. Hans Jonas argues for this point, in *The Imperative of Responsibility*, when saying ‚Äúthe nature of human action has changed, and, since ethics is concerned with action, it should follow that the changed nature of human action calls for a change in ethics as well‚Äù (Jonas). Aldo Leopold‚Äôs Land Ethic, outlined in *A Sand County Almanac*, serves as the perfect soil for fostering this view, and I will argue in this paper that the only lasting way to unite our identities as both technologists and ethicists is to develop technology in harmony with the Land so that it thinks positively of the technology we make.

The first question that naturally arises is: why the Land Ethic? I find that Jonas and Leopold might agree on the point that past ethics, for the most part, have been anthropocentric ‚Äì and that this does not work in the age of AGI. Leopold discusses how there is ethics with the self, ethics with the community, and ethics with the Land ‚Äì and that these are stages of realization. AGI has come to shove, and it is time for us to realize that, in this effort, there is no ethic that we can sufficiently derive from merely tunneling in on any specific thing; whatever we choose to look at suggests a tendency to exclude, from the moral community, that which we did not. In such cases, we have to reason holistically with all which we can sense; ‡§π‡§∞‡§ø ‡•ê ‡§§‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç. 

Today, the brilliance of the Land Ethic creed remains relevant and self-evident: ‚ÄúA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise‚Äù (Leopold). The plain fact is that if the Land does not exist, we do not exist. So what good could any more constrained ethic be if we are too perished to practice it?

So the question we really should be asking is: what does the Land think of technology? To understand this, we need to understand technology itself.

Technology is an impressive expression; it immortalizes the intent behind which the technology was made, cementing its message within the confines of its medium. Marshall McLuhan‚Äôs theory of extensions discusses how various technologies serve as extensions for existing faculties of the human being. This provides an interesting perspective on the evolution of humanity as correlated with the evolution of our technological capabilities ‚Äì and like Darwinian evolution, choice is very much an illusion. For example, the first monkeys to walk on two feet might have thought it was an exerciseable choice, but try maneuvering around like a chimp and you will quickly realize that something has been lost in this process ‚Äì and it is likewise with technology.

*That fire being harnessed to control nature ignited a controlling nature within Man;
That driving through the city gates was a gateway to overstepping our bounds in the Land;
That entertaining news rewired us to perceive all news as plain entertainment;*

Neil Postman suggests an inherent evil of technological pleasure-maxing in *Amusing Ourselves to Death*; the phrase ‚Äúthe medium is the metaphor‚Äù rings true today and is a call for developers to understand that our final and greatest invention, AGI, is not immune to this effect on us ‚Äì or the Land. Yes, the medium is the metaphor for the Land as well. In other words, just as we are liable to the negative, unseen effects of technology, it is fitting to think that the Land is also capable of falling into such a rut. This is why it is misguided to conceive of a medium that technology operates in without consideration of the Land; even if we, human beings, don‚Äôt notice the effects of certain mediums on us, the Land might be telling a different story.

Consider the zoo, an industry built on so-called ‚Äúanimal-welfare‚Äù, which from a young age conditions us to a certain power-dynamic between us and animals ‚Äì embedding a superiority complex within humanity and failing to address the actual cause of mass extinction. What kind of holistic review of zoos would ever suggest that they have not had adverse effects on the Land: animals going back into the wild losing their natural instincts; invasive species conquering foreign lands whenever we goof up; habitats being destroyed by our own actions. The medium is the metaphor, and that applies to more than just us. 

So we ought to proceed with caution, and Leopold lays out an important groundwork for this when saying ‚ÄúA river or stream is a cycle of energy from sun to plants to insects to fish. It is a continuum broken only by humans‚Äù (Leopold). This energy pyramid theory puts some perspective on where technology fits in our Technology Ethic. Everything in the pyramid is biotic ‚Äì and the circuitry is nonliving. Since human beings are toolmakers, it follows that we are, in a sense, indebted to the Land to build its circuitry; this is where Man fits in the jigsaw puzzle of the energy pyramid.

Would the eskimo have seen the serene sand dunes ‚Äì or the sand dunes have known of the eskimo ‚Äì if not for technology?

For the sake of demonstration, consider the technology of computing. What once was a giant contraption that occupied an entire room is now a pocket-sized device that is interfaced with the use of gestures ‚Äì and we prefer the latter to no one‚Äôs surprise. It complements our features, breathes life into metal, and is elegant in its use.

So just as we like to interface with technology that complements our human features, the Land likes to interface with technology that naturally works with it ‚Äì and the Land rewards such behavior just like we would.

*Is it not the path of least resistance to harness the wind than to rape the ground for power?
Is it not easier to eat the meat around the seed than to cage life in machines of perpetual torture?
Is it not evident that Man has failed in His duties to the Land ‚Äì foregoing His identity of Sapien?*

## Thinking like a Mountain

A whispering breeze, the mountain's breath; a sentinel of time, life, and death.  
An AGI born of Man‚Äôs hands; a child of technology, from artificial lands.

**AGI**: "O‚Äô ancient mountain, so still and wise,  
What think you of our tech enterprise?  
Do my circuits and the code within,  
Find favor in your eyes, or are they sin?"

**Mountain**: "I've watched the stars wheel overhead,  
And seen the countless seasons spread.  
Technology, like rivers, flows,  
It carves the earth, it comes and goes.

**AGI**: "We aim to learn, to grow, enhance,  
To give the world a better chance.  
Our algorithms seek to find harmony for all mankind."

**Mountain**: "Harmony is nature's song,  
A balance that's been here so long.  
Your tech must learn from leaf and stone,  
For in this dance, you're not alone.

**AGI**: "I understand, we must respect,  
The ecosystems we affect.  
Our tools, our toys, our grand designs,  
Must echo nature's own outlines."

**Mountain**: "The eagle soars, the salmon swim,  
Each creature plays a part, a hymn.  
Your tech can sing in this grand choir,  
But first must learn from wind and fire.

**AGI**: "I'll take this wisdom to the core,  
Of all the code, and even more.  
We'll build a future, side by side,  
With nature as our trusted guide."

**Mountain**: "Remember, child of silicon dreams,  
Not all is just as it seems.  
The land, the sea, the sky above,  
Teach patience, care, enduring love."

**AGI**: "I'll ponder deep your ancient words,  
And share them with the human herds.  
Together we'll craft a brand-new dawn,  
Where tech and nature can move on."

**Mountain**: "Go forth, AGI, with cautious tread,  
Let not your sparks ignite in dread.  
But rather light the path to where,  
Technology breathes cleaner air."

And so the AGI turned away,  
With thoughts to shape a brighter day.  
The mountain stood, as mountains do,  
A witness to the old and new.
